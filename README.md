# Apollo 13

Apollo 13 is a teambuilding program / serious game for (10-16 people + 2 game leaders) where the players have to cooperate in order to ensure the astronauts (game leaders) survive. The goal is to start simple with 1 or 2 challenges, and whenever the oxygen tank explodes, the players get filled with incidents. These incidents then have to be solved and can be solved when reading through all the manuals.

## Gameplay loop

1. Game Leaders report an incident
2. CAPCOM makes an incident card and gives it to the incident managers
3. The incident managers decide which expert has to solve it (or if they already have a similar incident solved)
4. The expert solves the problem
5. The incident managers sign it and give it back to CAPCOM
6. CAPCOM communicates the solution to the astronauts
7. The incident goes back to the incident managers for the log

## The goal

To make it as chaotic as possible so the incident managers really have to prioritize tasks and keep an eye on what is important to be solved and what not.

## Playtesting

The game has been playtested once, it was responded to as a difficult game, but something to get really invested into. Also the theme and the background knowledge was really fun.

## Final words

If you have any experiences you would like to share, I would love to hear about them! I would like it a lot to hear improvements, differences, and anything. Please open an issue with any experiences you would like to share.

The software is also open for improvements, I will accept any pull request that improves the game and the fun. This can be on the document itself, while also possible for the Unity game.
