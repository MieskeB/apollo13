# Apollo 13

Apollo 13 is a teambuilding program / serious game for (10-16 people + 2 game leaders) where the players have to cooperate in order to ensure the astronauts (game leaders) survive. The goal is to start simple with 1 or 2 challenges, and whenever the oxygen tank explodes, the players get filled with incidents. These incidents then have to be solved and can be solved when reading through all the manuals.

## Gameplay loop

1. Game Leaders report an incident
2. CAPCOM makes an incident card and gives it to the incident managers
3. The incident managers decide which expert has to solve it (or if they already have a similar incident solved)
4. The expert solves the problem
5. The incident managers sign it and give it back to CAPCOM
6. CAPCOM communicates the solution to the astronauts
7. The incident goes back to the incident managers for the log

## The goal

To make it as chaotic as possible so the incident managers really have to prioritize tasks and keep an eye on what is important to be solved and what not.

## Getting started

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Run the folder in Unity
3. Press the play button at the top to start the game
4. Open on a second monitor the folder C:/Users/[username]/AppData/LocalLow/Mindware Software/ and open the file located there in an automatic file reloading tool like VSCode
5. Print the files in the folder "Files" as many times as needed
6. Make sure the astronauts read these documents first!
7. To start in the application (after pressing the play button), press space to start the launch video (or when testing you can press s to skip the video instead)
8. The game will start automatically after the video and no extra input is required, other than values that can be changed in the document mentioned above

## Playtesting

The game has been playtested once, it was responded to as a difficult game, but something to get really invested into. Also the theme and the background knowledge was really fun.
